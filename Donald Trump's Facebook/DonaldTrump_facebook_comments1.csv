They claimed because she used a private email server while Secretary of State she wasn't trustworthy to handle highly-sensitive information pertaining to national security. Even after an FBI investigation that lasted over a year concluded that there was no criminal wrongdoing on her part, many of these Republicans continued to insist she be prosecuted, some even saying she deserved to be sent to prison over her mishandling of these documents.

Now let's take the long, extensive journey forward in time ‰ÛÓ about seven months ‰ÛÓ to present day.

Many of these same Republicans from the previous part of this story are now defending a sitting ""president"" after he willingly gave Russia, the same country that launched a cyber attack against our election last year, highly-sensitive classified intelligence. This all came right after he fired the head of the FBI, James Comey, a few weeks after the former director publicly testified to Congress that the current ""president's"" campaign is under investigation for potentially committing treason by colluding with Russia during last year's election.

However, that's not all!

Right around the same time this current ""president"" publicly threatened the former head of the FBI on Twitter. Then practically immediately after he made that public threat, reports surfaced alleging that, before Comey's firing, this same ""president"" most Republicans continue to defend tried to obstruct justice by pressuring the former head of the FBI to end his agency's investigation into this ""president's"" former national security advisor, Michael Flynn.

But fret not, everyone, this story isn't finished.

Long ago, during a ""darker"" time at the White House (or perhaps it was just a time when someone with darker skin lived there, I get those two confused), Republicans once were a party ""offended"" by many‰Û_ many things.

If someone hearing this story wasn't alive back then to remember the days when Republicans loved holding investigations, based on their apparent disdain for them today, one might think they always opposed any sort of congressional oversight.

Oh, how wrong you would be.

Way‰Û_ way back, I believe it was last July, Republicans officially ended their 28-month investigation into the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi. Back in those days, the GOP loved congressional investigations so much they held several, some basically identical to the others, over a span of time that lasted longer than the investigations into:

	‰Û¢	Pearl Harbor
	‰Û¢	JFK's assassination
	‰Û¢	Watergate
	‰Û¢	The 9/11 attacks

That's how much Republicans once loved congressional investigations. Even after concluding that many of the conspiracy theories some folks believed were associated with this attack were debunked, they commissioned more investigations just to make sure all of those previous ones were accurate.

My, how times have changed.

I even recall a time when this current ""president,"" and the party of which he's the leader, despised the game of golf. They were strongly ""offended"" that someone living in the White House would waste the American taxpayer's money playing the silly game. They were ""appalled"" that this leader of our nation would dare to do anything but spend every moment in Washington.

Obviously they've evolved greatly over such a vast period of time. Now most seem perfectly fine with the current ""president"" spending many weekends traveling to Florida resorts, playing golf, and spending taxpayer money ‰ÛÓ at a record pace, no less ‰ÛÓ on personal travel expenses.

There was also a time when most of these same Republicans thought presidents who signed executive orders were ""unconstitutional,"" ""acting like dictators,"" or ""ruling like a king."" Their disdain for such singular action from the Executive Branch even prompted a few to suggest a former president be impeached over one such executive order protecting DREAMers from being deported.

Such different times in which we're currently living.

Nowadays most Republicans seem rather fond of a ""president"" signing executive orders. They've even gone as far as to support ‰ÛÓ twice ‰ÛÓ measures to ban millions of people from being able to travel into the United States.

For some, the days of the Cold War seem like yesterday. To Republicans, ""Saint"" Ronald Reagan stood up valiantly against the evil communists. Even after the demise of the ""evil empire,"" while not the same type of adversary as before, Russia was still a nation that could never truly be trusted. Especially with the rise of former KGB agent turned quasi-dictator Vladimir Putin becoming the nation's president. Even fairly recently, Republicans openly mocked the idea of a previous administration doing a ""reset"" to improve relations between the two nations.

Obviously those days are long gone as millions of Republicans, and the GOP as a whole, embraced the most pro-Russia candidate in American history. A man who, as ""president-elect,"" heaped praise on the Russian president, while attacking our own U.S. intelligence agencies, after they publicly identified Russia as the culprit behind the attack aimed at undermining U.S. democracy. Now it seems, with so much time passingbetween that cyber attack and today, many within the GOP are more than accepting of our current ""president"" sharing highly-classified intelligence with the very nation that attacked us so many moons ago.

So, what's the moral of the story here?

Republicans have none.""

So here are the Democrat's values:
1) guilty until proven innocent without Court
2) illegal aliens are good but cops are not
3) Military defectors and Military treasonous transgenders deserve benefits.
3) insults against the president's daughter are okay unless it's a Democrat
4) protest actually means Riot and cause property damage
5) cheat to win an election but when you lose make up a story about people that cheated to win an election
6) play the race card to try to win votes but if you lose ignore the minorities
7) fight against an independent counsel when there is proof of laws being broken and demand and independent counsel when there is no proof of laws being broken.",Tony Mucci,20/5/17 10:10,510159167535600725_1863553637190762,153080620724_10159167535600725,10159167535600725_10159167539860725,"Jesse Short, please tell me the term of Dan Quayle's presidency",Vanessa Fritsch,20/5/17 10:10,210159167535600725_269244863541337,153080620724_10159167535600725,10159167535600725_10159167539860725,Never you idiot....,Ronda Barnes,20/5/17 10:10,010159167535600725_269245000207990,153080620724_10159167535600725,10159167535600725_10159167539860725,Larry Brusuelas how many have you talked about with your buddy's Larry ?,Randy Mac Tina King,20/5/17 10:11,010159167535600725_1906166092973819,153080620724_10159167535600725,10159167535600725_10159167539860725,"Charles Landry, sorry buddy .

This brings our plight into focus. How, in the world, could we not see this coming and stop it in the election four years ago. Sad commentary on where our head is, as a Nation. ALL Of A Sudden‰Û_.Seven Short Years Have Passed! Before Obama there was virtually no outlandish presence of Islam in America. All of a sudden, Islam is taught in schools. Christianity and the bible are banned in schools. All of a sudden we must allow prayer rugs everywhere and allow for Islamic prayer in schools, airports and businesses. All of a sudden we must stop serving pork in prisons. All of a sudden we are inundated with law suits by Muslims who are offended by American culture. All of a sudden we must allow burkas to be worn everywhere even though you have no idea who or what is in them. All of a sudden Muslims are suing employers and refusing to do their jobs if they personally deem it conflicts with Sharia Law. All of a sudden the Attorney General of the United States vows to prosecute anyone who engages in ""anti-Muslim speech"". All of a sudden, Jihadists who engage in terrorism and openly admit they acted in the name of Islam and ISIS, are emphatically declared they are NOT Islamic by our leaders and/or their actions are determined NOT to be terrorism, but other nebulous terms like 'workplace violence."" All of a sudden, it becomes Policy that Secular Middle East dictators that were benign or friendly to the West, must be replaced by Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood. All of a sudden our troops are withdrawn from Iraq and the middle east, giving rise to ISIS. All of a sudden, America has reduced its nuclear stockpiles to 1950 levels, as Obama's stated goal of a nuke-free America by the time he leaves office continues uninterrupted. All of a sudden, a deal with Iran must be made at any cost, with a pathway to nuclear weapons and HUNDREDS of BILLIONS of dollars handed over to fund their programs. All of a sudden America APOLOGIZES to Muslim states and sponsors of terror worldwide for acts of aggression, war and sabotage THEY perpetrate against our soldiers. All of a sudden, the American Navy is diminished to 1917 Pre-World War I levels of only 300 ships. The Army is at pre-1940 levels. The Air Force scraps 500 planes and planned to retire the use of the A-10 Thunderbolt close air support fighter. A further draw down of another 40,000 military personnel is in progress. All of a sudden half of our aircraft carriers are recalled for maintenance by Obama rendering the Atlantic unguarded, NONE are in the Middle East. All of a sudden Obama has to empty Guantanamo Bay of captured Jihadists and let them loose in Jihad-friendly Islamic states. He demands to close the facility. All of a sudden America will negotiate with terrorists and trade FIVE Taliban commanders for a deserter and Jihad sympathizer. All of a sudden there is no money for American poor, disabled veterans, jobless Americans, hungry Americans, or displaced Americans but there is endless money for Obama's ""Syrian refugee"" resettlement programs. All of sudden there is an ammunition shortage in the USA. All of a sudden, the most important thing for Obama to do after a mass shooting by two Jihadists, is disarm American Citizens. All of a sudden, the President of the United States cannot attend the Christian Funerals of a Supreme Court Justice and a former First Lady because of previous (seemingly unimportant) commitments. All of a sudden, I'm sick to my stomach. I'm not sure the majority of Americans recognize the seriousness of the situation and how much progress has been made by Islam these last 7 years, a very brief time compared to a 75 year lifetime!",Karilee Mazzocchi,20/5/17 10:14,210159167535600725_1906167679640327,153080620724_10159167535600725,10159167535600725_10159167539860725,Infaaz Ali Nymar good we hate your stupid cult too.,Bob Cousins,20/5/17 10:14,110159167535600725_309350822850681,153080620724_10159167535600725,10159167535600725_10159167539860725,http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.790476 [[SHARE]],Cyrus Javan,20/5/17 10:14,010159167535600725_656917177832292,153080620724_10159167535600725,10159167535600725_10159167539860725,Manlio Villa  Same on you!,Maureen Davern,20/5/17 10:14,010159167535600725_1906167866306975,153080620724_10159167535600725,10159167535600725_10159167539860725,"Larry Brusuelas Perhaps he's on the look out for wife #4?

In 2017.  we are going to find out that the man is of extraterrestrial origin. The solar system is an artificial creation. Scientists will announce in 2017.  that the solar system is an artificial creation.To be more precise, it will be revealed that it is a machinery, and not of natural origin,as we used to think. The Sun, the Moon and the other planets are ""repairing and cleaning"" at present,thus a large number of alien spaceships are circling all around,even around our planet and our sky. The Moon has been also artificially created and in the past it was dragged closed to the Earth, in order to maintain its gravity. 

Planet Earth will be equipped with a help of the more evolved universe to step into 4D, and we will endure everything: cold, heat, disasters, crises and UFOs. Listen only to your heart and be constructive, not destructive, aggressive or fearful. Let us be positively active about the people around us, the planet and the universe. This year we have one requirement - to learn two cosmic laws: the first one is to love our planet and the universe, and the second is to learn that only our thought creates our world,destiny and our future. Thus,let us take a positive attitude and unite with similar people on the planet, because it is the only way to learn faster and make evolutionary progress in this stormy, but very crucial times.Times in which the all of us live together on planet Earth.The higher universe,into which all of us are going to sail, without exception in 2017 ,expects that from us and it tells us clearly by powerful fusion of our human consciousness with the alien presence on this planet and around it,unprecedentedly.

 here's a laundry list of President Trump's broken campaign promises.

He said he wouldn't bomb Syria. You bought it. Then he bombed Syria.

He said he'd build a wall along the border with Mexico. You bought it. Now his secretary of homeland security says ""It's unlikely that we will build a wall.""

He said he'd clean the Washington swamp. You bought it. Then he brought into his administration more billionaires, CEOs, and Wall Street moguls than in any administration in history, to make laws that will enrich their businesses.

He said he'd repeal Obamacare and replace it with something ""wonderful."" You bought it. Then he didn't.

He said he'd use his business experience to whip the White House into shape. You bought it. Then he created the most chaotic, dysfunctional, back-stabbing White House in modern history, in which no one is in charge.

He said he'd release his tax returns, eventually. You bought it. He hasn't, and says he never will.

He said he'd divest himself from his financial empire, to avoid any conflicts of interest. You bought it. 

He remains heavily involved in his businesses, makes money off of foreign dignitaries staying at his Washington hotel, gets China to give the Trump brand trademark and copyright rights, manipulates the stock market on a daily basis, and has more conflicts of interest than can even be counted.

He said Clinton was in the pockets of Goldman Sachs, and would do whatever they said. You bought it. Then he put half a dozen Goldman Sachs executives in positions of power in his administration.

He said he'd surround himself with all the best and smartest people. You bought it. Then he put Betsy DeVos, opponent of public education, in charge of education; Jeff Sessions, opponent of the Voting Rights Act, in charge of voting rights; Ben Carson, opponent of the Fair Housing Act, in charge of fair housing; Scott Pruitt, climate change denier, in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency; and Russian quisling Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.

He said he'd faithfully execute the law. You bought it. Then he said his predecessor, Barack Obama, spied on him, without any evidence of Obama ever doing so, in order to divert attention from the FBI's investigation into collusion between his campaign and Russian operatives to win the election.

He said he knew more about strategy and terrorism than the generals did. You bought it. Then he green lighted a disastrous raid in Yemen- even though  his generals said it would be a terrible idea. This raid resulted in the deaths of a Navy SEAL, an 8-year old American girl, and numerous civilians. The actual target of the raid escaped, and no useful intel was gained

He called Barack Obama ""the vacationer-in-Chief"" and accused him of playing more rounds of golf than Tiger Woods. He promised to never be the kind of president who took cushy vacations on the taxpayer's dime, not when there was so much important work to be done. You bought it. He has by now spent more taxpayer money on vacations than Obama did in the first 3 years of his presidency. Not to mention all the money taxpayers are spending protecting his family, including his two sons who travel all over the world on Trump business.

He called CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times ""fake news"" and said they were his enemy. You bought it. Now he gets his information from Fox News, Breitbart, Gateway Pundit, and InfoWars.

All over our nation, people are joining together in prayer agreement today and for the next 60 days to pray this prayer for the protection of our President!

Dear HEAVENLY FATHER GOD, we ask in JESUS CHRIST NAME that You set Your Holy Angels all about and keeping safe President Donald Trump,
Vice-President Mike Pence and their families, as well as those working with them in this administration.

IN JESUS' NAME, we ask that any plots to do harm to the President, Vice President, or their families or those in their administration, be uncovered, found out and stopped! By Your HOLY SPIRIT, reveal those plotting harm to President Trump or those with him, that they be exposed on every level: from those plotting and planning an attack, to those executing and even financing the attack. We pray that all would be revealed, apprehended and prosecuted to the full letter of the law.

Oh Precious HEAVENLY FATHER, grant President Trump wisdom in what he decides, and to have Holy Spirit leading in all things.

Lord JESUS, Commission and Appoint us by Your Holy Spirit to be empowered to deal with all the demonic forces trying to do harm to President Trump and who work to block him and mislead him.
Uncover demonic lies and deceptions.

So here are the Democrat's values:

2) illegal aliens are good but cops are not
3) Military defectors and Military treasonous transgenders deserve benefits.
3) insults against the president's daughter are okay unless it's a Democrat
4) protest actually means Riot and cause property damage
5) cheat to win an election but when you lose make up a story about people that cheated to win an election
6) play the race card to try to win votes but if you lose ignore the minorities

All over our nation, people are joining together in prayer agreement today and for the next 60 days to pray this prayer for the protection of our President!

Dear HEAVENLY FATHER GOD, we ask in JESUS CHRIST NAME that You set Your Holy Angels all about and keeping safe President Donald Trump,
Vice-President Mike Pence and their families, as well as those working with them in this administration.

IN JESUS' NAME, we ask that any plots to do harm to the President, Vice President, or their families or those in their administration, be uncovered, found out and stopped! By Your HOLY SPIRIT, reveal those plotting harm to President Trump or those with him, that they be exposed on every level: from those plotting and planning an attack, to those executing and even financing the attack. We pray that all would be revealed, apprehended and prosecuted to the full letter of the law.

Oh Precious HEAVENLY FATHER, grant President Trump wisdom in what he decides, and to have Holy Spirit leading in all things.

Lord JESUS, Commission and Appoint us by Your Holy Spirit to be empowered to deal with all the demonic forces trying to do harm to President Trump and who work to block him and mislead him.

 here's a laundry list of President Trump's broken campaign promises.

He said he wouldn't bomb Syria. You bought it. Then he bombed Syria.

He said he'd build a wall along the border with Mexico. You bought it. Now his secretary of homeland security says ""It's unlikely that we will build a wall.""

He said he'd clean the Washington swamp. You bought it. Then he brought into his administration more billionaires, CEOs, and Wall Street moguls than in any administration in history, to make laws that will enrich their businesses.

He said he'd repeal Obamacare and replace it with something ""wonderful."" You bought it. Then he didn't.

He said he'd use his business experience to whip the White House into shape. You bought it. Then he created the most chaotic, dysfunctional, back-stabbing White House in modern history, in which no one is in charge.

He said he'd release his tax returns, eventually. You bought it. He hasn't, and says he never will.

He said he'd divest himself from his financial empire, to avoid any conflicts of interest. You bought it. 

He remains heavily involved in his businesses, makes money off of foreign dignitaries staying at his Washington hotel, gets China to give the Trump brand trademark and copyright rights, manipulates the stock market on a daily basis, and has more conflicts of interest than can even be counted.

He said Clinton was in the pockets of Goldman Sachs, and would do whatever they said. You bought it. Then he put half a dozen Goldman Sachs executives in positions of power in his administration.

He said he'd surround himself with all the best and smartest people. You bought it. Then he put Betsy DeVos, opponent of public education, in charge of education; Jeff Sessions, opponent of the Voting Rights Act, in charge of voting rights; Ben Carson, opponent of the Fair Housing Act, in charge of fair housing; Scott Pruitt, climate change denier, in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency; and Russian quisling Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.

He said he'd faithfully execute the law. You bought it. Then he said his predecessor, Barack Obama, spied on him, without any evidence of Obama ever doing so, in order to divert attention from the FBI's investigation into collusion between his campaign and Russian operatives to win the election.

He said he knew more about strategy and terrorism than the generals did. You bought it. Then he green lighted a disastrous raid in Yemen- even though  his generals said it would be a terrible idea. This raid resulted in the deaths of a Navy SEAL, an 8-year old American girl, and numerous civilians. The actual target of the raid escaped, and no useful intel was gained

He called Barack Obama ""the vacationer-in-Chief"" and accused him of playing more rounds of golf than Tiger Woods. He promised to never be the kind of president who took cushy vacations on the taxpayer's dime, not when there was so much important work to be done. You bought it. He has by now spent more taxpayer money on vacations than Obama did in the first 3 years of his presidency. Not to mention all the money taxpayers are spending protecting his family, including his two sons who travel all over the world on Trump business.

He called CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times ""fake news"" and said they were his enemy. You bought it. Now he gets his information from Fox News, Breitbart, Gateway Pundit, and InfoWars.

Math can optimize prices across industries to make the economy more efficient and fair. Lets say it took a 10% prices increase for a 10% wage increase...on a $25k yealy income it would rise $2500 while common items tools food electonics would rise 10% or roughly $5 on most items $80 for a TV which you only buy every 3 or 4 years...there is room to adust wages and prices but it will take demands from voters for govt and indistry to negotiate.

So when the U.S. Navy bombs a small country that never attacked them like Syria, over an obvious Saudi financed false flag chemical attack on civilians as proven in the past, with a first U.S. wave alone of 59 Tomahawk missiles at 1.87 million dollars a piece, and the navy has to reorder more of those very expensive cruise missiles to replenish their reserves, guess who's investment stocks go up? So President Trump as the finger on the button that makes his own investment stocks in weapons manufactures rise up; not that the Clintons or Obama or the Bushes didn't have stocks as well. So like in the Bush cartel days, American taxpayers are pretty much financing the enrichment of weapons stock holder politicians, where the expression ""War Profiteering"" comes to mind. Is this a total conflict of interest? Yes! Should there be laws to prevent this? Yes! Will politicians on all sides be able to discipline themselves? Don't count on it, as the very reason most people go into politics is not really to help out the country, but to help themselves and fill out their pockets, as war is very profiting for some of the elite, even if others have to die at the other end; where the hypocrisy of political argument and blaming game in Washington between Republicans and Democrats, when one is really not much better than the other and both act like crooks. And people still wonder why small countries want a nuclear arsenal to protect themselves against such political gangsterism. America is not alone in this business, as most major countries throughout the world have their own war profiteers in governments. It's all the same racket really, selling weapons to naive taxpayers pushed into war, when not selling it to brutal Middle East dictatorships like Saudi Arabia, even providing them with small tactical nuclear neutron bombs to keep shooting at Yemen; all keeping up with the world's demand for weapons of mass destruction. Why do you think President Trump's first foreign visit is Saudi Arabia, to exchange Mohammad Arabic jokes and eat shawarma? Instead of realizing that the bombs and US foreign policy are the actual sources of terrorism, warmonger politicians like Bush, Obama, and now Trump use fear to steal tax dollars, to feed this machine they themselves profit from. With this short term profit thinking, we might just end up with those very same weapons falling right back on our heads someday.

Trump's investments cross a wide spectrum of industries, with technology companies, financial firms, defense contractors, and energy, all represented in his portfolio. Trump also owns stock in many well-known companies including Apple, Nike, Whole Foods, Google, Philip Morris, Raytheon weapon manufacturer, Facebook, and Morgan Stanley, among others. Trump's money invested in energy also explains his push for so called clean coal, as he surely has investments in there too. Whenever this President finally decides to start building the southern border wall with Mexico, he will surely have his own profit to be made out of it with his own construction companies. If Donald Trump pushes for something, it's only because he's got a profit to make. Such huge conflict of interest would be a more genuine reason to impeach a President, rather than the simple dismissal of a gross incompetent crooked FBI director.

I no longer have a side in all this politics, as I find most Republicans and Democrats to be just as hypocrites and liars to get what they want; and what they want is people's money, anyway they can get it, short of being hanged for treason; and in my view some have already passed that line.

Saudi Bikers Rally Against Terror
http://www.wsj.com/‰Û_/trump-trip-to-saudi-ar‰Û_/card/1495229382

That part of the world is a total Charley Foxtrot. When you peel back the layers of this onion all you find is more rotten onion. The Saud family is in a tightspot. They're caught between their own Wahabist control freaks and the revolutionary rise of the Shias in Iran and frankly, the prospects for the Saud family dynasty do not look so good at the moment.

I don't trust them but if they come out against terrorism today, tomorrow we can get them to put their money where their mouths are. Maybe. The problem is that while Iran may be the world's largest state sponsor of terror, Saudi Arabia is the world's largest financial sponsor of evangelizing creeping Islam.

We have an opportunity here to help forge an alliance aimed at stabilizing the middle east and stopping the Iranian spread of Shia Islam. We also need to insist that the Saud family stop the Wahabi Salafist funding of mosques in the United States.

On every front, you're faced with legal, political and moral hazards. The president's job, and yours, is a lot harder than it looked, and you know the problem originates in the Oval Office.

I'm getting ready for my big foreign trip.
I will be strongly protecting American interests‰ÛÓthat's what I like to do!
The airplane ride is hours and hours. I get lots of screen time! No one wants to give me my phone, but I shout and shout until they say OK.
On the plane, the pilot pins shiny wings to my jacket. Yay! I like planes as much as I like trucks!
Our first stop is Saudi Arabia. Jared says it is like a beach, big and hot and full of sand. No girls are allowed on the beach.
They eat crazy food in Saudi Arabia, like hummus! But I get to order a steak with ketchup, just the way I like it.
Mr. Steve tells me Muslims are the bad guys, but General Jim says I have to be nice to them. It's confusing!
I wish General Mike was here. I'm not allowed to play with him anymore.
After Saudi Arabia we go to Israel, where the best Jews live. My friend Bibi sneaks into my room after dark and tells me scary stories about the bad ISIS men. I can't wait to go home and tell my friends Sergey and Sergey.
I don't want to go to the sad museum.
In Italy, they call pizza PIZZA! My teachers tell me that if I sit by myself and think about the long-term economic and security benefits of our multilateral North Atlantic defense regime, I can have pepperoni.
I get to meet the ""pope""!
Don't tell anyone, but before I left I was a little bit scared about my trip.
What if the other leaders laughed at me?
What if I had to touch Melania?
What if I had an accident?
But Ivanka said I should be brave. ""Who's my big brave boy?"" Ivanka asked me.
""I am,"" I said. ""I'm a big brave boy.""
It's been an exciting trip, but when it's over, I'll be glad to be home at Mar-a-Lago, where I get as much ice cream as I want.",Nick Poverman,20/5/17 9:43,010159167535600725_309338912851872,153080620724_10159167535600725,10159167535600725_269228836876273,#MAGA‰ù_•üè_Ùà__Ùàü‰ù_•üè_Ùà__Ùàü,Carol McDonald,20/5/17 9:52,210159167535600725_1359814037432115,153080620724_10159167535600725,,Too funny...

I say ""colluded"" b/c our Constitution says the government cannot print fiat money (money that's not backed by gold or silver) so by creating the Federal Reserve, our country began borrowing fiat money from banks, at an interest rate they set AND they set rules in motion that the banks don't have to abide by laws that U.S. Citizens abide to.

The law does not provide for the same legal status and rights for women as for men, and since there is no codified personal-status law, judges made decisions regarding family matters based on their interpretations of Islamic law. Although they may legally own property and are entitled to financial support from their guardian, women have fewer political or social rights than men, and society treated them as unequal members in the political and social spheres. The guardianship system requires that every woman have a close male relative as her ""guardian"" with the legal authority to approve her travel outside of the country. A guardian also has authority to approve some types of business licenses and study at a university or college. Women can make their own determinations concerning hospital care. Women can work without their guardian's permission, but most employers required women to have such permission.

I'm getting ready for my big foreign trip.
I will be strongly protecting American interests‰ÛÓthat's what I like to do!
The airplane ride is hours and hours. I get lots of screen time! No one wants to give me my phone, but I shout and shout until they say OK.
On the plane, the pilot pins shiny wings to my jacket. Yay! I like planes as much as I like trucks!
Our first stop is Saudi Arabia. Jared says it is like a beach, big and hot and full of sand. No girls are allowed on the beach.
They eat crazy food in Saudi Arabia, like hummus! But I get to order a steak with ketchup, just the way I like it.
Mr. Steve tells me Muslims are the bad guys, but General Jim says I have to be nice to them. It's confusing!
I wish General Mike was here. I'm not allowed to play with him anymore.
After Saudi Arabia we go to Israel, where the best Jews live. My friend Bibi sneaks into my room after dark and tells me scary stories about the bad ISIS men. I can't wait to go home and tell my friends Sergey and Sergey.
I don't want to go to the sad museum.
In Italy, they call pizza PIZZA! My teachers tell me that if I sit by myself and think about the long-term economic and security benefits of our multilateral North Atlantic defense regime, I can have pepperoni.
I get to meet the ""pope""!
Don't tell anyone, but before I left I was a little bit scared about my trip.
What if the other leaders laughed at me?
What if I had to touch Melania?
What if I had an accident?
But Ivanka said I should be brave. ""Who's my big brave boy?"" Ivanka asked me.
""I am,"" I said. ""I'm a big brave boy.""

 non Muslim women are not expected to cover their hair or face but are expected to dress respectfully and that is what Melaina did!!!
