--------------------------------------
Friends, Members of Congress, Ambassadors, Veterans and, most especially, to the Survivors here with us today: it is an honor to join you on this solemn occasion. I am deeply moved to stand before those who survived history's darkest hour. Your cherished presence transforms this place into a sacred gathering.

Thank you, Tom Bernstein, Alan Holt, Sara Bloomfield, and everyone at the Holocaust Memorial Council and Museum for your vital work and tireless contributions.

We are privileged to be joined by Israel's Ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer. The State of Israel is an eternal monument to the undying strength of the Jewish People. A fervent dream that burned in the hearts of the oppressed, is now filled with the breath of life â€“ and the Star of David waves atop a great nation arisen from the desert.

To those in the audience who have served America in uniform: our country thanks you. We are proud and grateful to be joined today by Veterans of the Second World War who liberated survivors from the Camps. Your sacrifice helped save freedom for the world. 

Sadly, this year marks the first Day of Remembrance since the passing of Elie Wiesel.

His absence leaves an empty space in our hearts, but his spirit fills this room â€“ it is the kind and gentle spirit of an angel who lived through hell, and whose courage still lights the path from darkness.

Though ELL-EE's story is well known, it is always worth repeating. He suffered the unthinkable horrors of the Holocaust. His mother and sister perished at Auschwitz. He watched his father slowly dying before his own young eyes in Buchenwald. He lived through an endless nightmare of murder and death â€“ and he inscribed on our collective conscience the duty we have to remember that long dark night so as never to repeat it.

The Survivors in this hall, through their testimony, fulfill the righteous duty to never forget â€“ and engrave into the world's memory the Nazi Genocide of the Jewish People.

You witnessed evil beyond description. Many of you lost your entire family â€“ everything and everyone you loved. You saw mothers and children led to mass slaughter. You saw the starvation and the torture. You saw the organized attempt at the extermination of an entire people. You survived the ghettos, the Concentration Camps and the Death Camps. And you persevered to tell your stories. You tell of these living nightmares because, despite your great pain, you believe in ELL-EE's famous plea, that ""For the dead and the living, we must bear witness.""  

That is why we are here today. To remember and to bear witness. To make sure that humanity, never, ever forgets. The Nazis massacred 6 million Jews. Two out of every three Jews in Europe were murdered in the genocide. Millions more innocent people were imprisoned and executed by the Nazis without mercy.

Yet, even today, there are those who want to forget the past â€“ worse still, there are even those filled with such hate that they want to erase the Holocaust from history. Those who deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to its evil, and we will never be silent in the face of evil again.

Denying the Holocaust is only one of many forms of dangerous Anti-Semitism that continue around the world. We've seen Anti-Semitism on university campuses, in the public square, and in threats against Jewish citizens. Even worse, it's been on display in the most sinister manner when terrorists attack Jewish Communities â€“ or when aggressors threaten Israel with destruction.

This is my pledge to you: 
We will confront Anti-Semitism. 
We will stamp out prejudice.  
We will condemn hatred.  
We will bear witness. 
And we will act.

As President of the United States, I will always stand with the Jewish people â€“ and I will always stand with our great friend and partner, the State of Israel.

So today, we remember the 6 million Jewish men, women and children whose lives and dreams were stolen from this earth. 

We remember the millions of other innocent victims the Nazis so brutally targeted and killed.

We remember the survivors who bore more than we can imagine.

We remember the hatred and evil that sought to extinguish human life, dignity, and freedom.
But we also remember the light that shone through the darkness.

We remember sisters and brothers who gave everything to those they loved â€“ survivors like Steven Springfield who in the long death march carried his brother on his back. As he said, ""I just couldn't give in.""

We remember the brave souls who banded together to save the lives of their neighbors â€“ even at the risk of their own.

And we remember those first hopeful moments of liberation, when at long last the American soldiers arrived in camps and cities throughout occupied Europe â€“ waving the same beautiful flags before us today, speaking those three glorious words: ""you are free.""

It is this love of freedom, this embrace of human dignity â€“ this call to courage in the face of evil â€“ that the Survivors here today have helped to write onto our hearts. The Jewish people have endured oppression, persecution, and those who have sought and planned their destruction. Yet, through the suffering, they have persevered. They have thrived. And they have enlightened the world.
We stand in awe of the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish People.

I want to close with a story â€“ enshrined in the Museum â€“ that captures the moment of liberation in the final days of the war.

It is the story of Gerda Klein, a young Jewish woman from Poland. Some of you know her. Gerda's family was murdered by the Nazis. She spent three years imprisoned in labor camps â€“ and the last four months of the war on a terrible death march. At the end, on the eve of her 21st birthday, her hair had lost all of its color, and she weighed a mere 68 pounds. Yet she had the will to live another day.  
 
Gerda later recalled the moment she realized that her long-awaited deliverance had arrived. She saw a car coming towards her. Many cars had driven up before. But this one was different. On its hood, in place of that wretched swastika, was a bright, beautiful white star.
 
Two American soldiers got out. One walked up to her. The first thing Gerda said was what she had been trained to say: ""We are Jewish, you know.""
 
That American soldier paused. And then he said, ""so am I.""
 
It was a beautiful moment after so much darkness.
 
As Gerda took this solider to see the other prisoners, the American did something she had long forgotten to even expect: he opened the door for her.
 
In Gerda's words, ""that was the moment of restoration of humanity, of humaneness, dignity, and freedom.""
 
But the story does not end there. Because as some of you know, that young American soldier who liberated her, and who showed her such decency, would soon become her husband. A year later, they were married.
 
In her words, ""He opened not only the door for me, but the door to my life and my future.""
 
Gerda has since spent her life telling the world of what she witnessed. She, like those Survivors among us today, has dedicated her life to shining a light of hope through the dark of night.
 
Your courage strengthens us. Your voices inspire us. And your stories remind us that we must never, ever, shrink away from telling the truth about evil in our time.
 
Evil is always seeking to wage war against the innocent, and to destroy all that is good and beautiful about our common humanity.
 
But evil can only thrive in darkness.
 
And what you have brought us today is so much more powerful than evil. You have brought us hope. Hope that love will conquer hatred, that right will defeat wrong, and that peace will rise from the ashes of war.
 
Each Survivor here today is a beacon of light â€“ and it only takes one light to illuminate even the darkest space. Just like it takes only one truth to crush a thousand lies, and one hero to change the course of history.
 
We know that in the end, good will triumph over evil.  And that as long as we refuse to close our eyes, or to silence our voices, we know that justice will ultimately prevail.
 
So today we mourn. We remember. We pray. And we pledge: NEVER AGAIN.

-----------------------------------
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
 
A PROCLAMATION
 
On Yom HaShoah  the day of Holocaust Remembrance  and during this Week of Remembrance, we honor the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution.  
 
â€‹The Holocaust was the state-sponsored, systematic persecution and attempted annihilation of European Jewry by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. By the end of World War II, six million Jews had been brutally slaughtered. The Nazis also targeted other groups for persecution and murder, including Roma (Gypsies), persons with mental and physical disabilities, Soviet prisoners of war, Jehovah's Witnesses, Slavs and other peoples of Europe, gays, and political opponents.
 
â€‹The United States stands shoulder to shoulder with the survivors of the Holocaust, their families, and the descendants of those who were murdered. We support the Jewish diaspora and the State of Israel as we fulfill our duty to remember the victims, honor their memory and their lives, and celebrate humanity's victory over tyranny and evil.  Holocaust survivors, despite scars from history's darkest days, continue to inspire us to remember the past and learn from its lessons. By sharing their experiences and wisdom, they continue to fuel our resolve to advance human rights and to combat antisemitism and other forms of hatred.
 
â€‹During this week in 1945, American and Allied forces liberated the concentration camp at Dachau and other Nazi death camps, laying bare to the world the unconscionable horror of the Holocaust. We must remain vigilant against hateful ideologies and indifference.  Every generation must learn and apply the lessons of the Holocaust so that such horror, atrocity, and genocide never again occur. It is our solemn obligation to reaffirm our commitment to respecting the fundamental freedoms and inherent dignity of every human being.
 
â€‹Let us join together to remember and honor the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution. We express our eternal gratitude to the liberators who selflessly risked their lives to save those of others, and we pledge to never be bystanders to evil.
 
â€‹We must never forget.â€‹
 
â€‹NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby ask the people of the United States to observe the Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, April 23 through April 30, 2017, and the solemn anniversary of the liberation of Nazi death camps, with appropriate study, prayers and commemoration, and to honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution by internalizing the lessons of this atrocity so that it is never repeated.
 
â€‹IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of April, in the year two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

But, most importantly, we are translating these meetings into action. 

One by one, we are checking off the promises we made to the people of the United States. And we will not stop until the job is done.

âœ”ï¸èWe will reduce taxes.
âœ”ï¸èWe will cut regulations.
âœ”ï¸èWe will support our police.
âœ”ï¸èWe will defend our flag.
âœ”ï¸èWe will rebuild our military.
âœ”ï¸èWe will take care of our Veterans.
âœ”ï¸èWe will fix our trade deals.
âœ”ï¸èWe will cut wasteful spending.
âœ”ï¸èWe will promote our values.
âœ”ï¸èWe will rebuild our inner cities.
âœ”ï¸èAnd we will bring back our jobs and our dreams.

The forgotten men and women of America will be forgotten no longer. That is the heart of this new movement â€“ and the future of the Republican Party. 

The GOP will be the party of the American Worker. We will not answer to donors or lobbyists or special interests â€“ but we will serve the citizens of the United States of America. Global cooperation is important.  But there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency, or a global flag.

There is one allegiance that unites us all, and that is our allegiance to America. No matter our background, or income, or geography â€“ we are all citizens of this blessed land. And no matter our color, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.

We all salute the same American Flag. And we are all made equal by the same Almighty God.

As long as we have faith in each other, and trust in God, then there is no goal beyond our reach. There is no dream too large, no task too great. We are Americans.  And the future belongs to us.

The future belongs to all of you. And America is about to come roaring back â€“ Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.

As part of my pledge to restore safety for the American People, I have also directed the Defense Community to develop a plan to destroy ISIS. Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the Earth.
At the same time, we understand that national security begins with border security.  Foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into America.

So let me state this as clearly as I can: we are going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country. We will not be deterred from this course. And, in a matter of days, we will be taking brand new action to protect our people and keep America Safe.

Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held their first official meeting today in Washington, D.C. and affirmed their longstanding commitment to close cooperation in addressing both the challenges facing our two countries and problems around the world.  

No two countries share deeper or broader relations than Canada and the United States.  We are bound together by our history, our values, our economy, our environment, and our resolve to improve the lives of our citizens.  Our close relationship and ongoing collaboration allow us to successfully meet any challenges we may face over the coming years, and to build a prosperous future for the people of both countries.

Neighbors in Growing our Economies

We recognize our profound shared economic interests, and will work tirelessly to provide growth and jobs for both countries.  Canada is the most important foreign market for thirty-five U.S. States, and more than $2 billion in two-way trade flows across our shared border every day.  Millions of American and Canadian middle-class jobs, including in the manufacturing sector, depend on our partnership.  We affirm the importance of building on this existing strong foundation for trade and investment and further deepening our relationship, with the common goal of strengthening the middle class.  

The United States and Canada also recognize the importance of cooperation to promote economic growth, provide benefits to our consumers and businesses, and advance free and fair trade.  We will continue our dialogue on regulatory issues and pursue shared regulatory outcomes that are business-friendly, reduce costs, and increase economic efficiency without compromising health, safety, and environmental standards.  We will work together regarding labor mobility in various economic sectors.  

Given our shared focus on infrastructure investments, we will encourage opportunities for companies in both countries to create jobs through those investments.  In particular, we look forward to the expeditious completion of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which will serve as a vital economic link between our two countries.    

Energy Security and Environment

U.S.-Canada energy and environmental cooperation are inextricably linked, and we commit to further improving our ties in those areas.  We have built the world's largest energy trading relationship.  We share the goals of energy security, a robust and secure energy grid, and a strong and resilient energy infrastructure that contributes to energy efficiency in both countries.  We collaborate closely on energy innovation, particularly in the clean energy sphere.  As the process continues for the Keystone XL pipeline, we remain committed to moving forward on energy infrastructure projects that will create jobs while respecting the environment.

We also look forward to building on our many areas of environmental cooperation, particularly along our border and at the Great Lakes, and we will continue to work together to enhance the quality of our air and water. 

Partners in Keeping our Border Secure

We recognize the security of our borders as a top priority.  Together, we address security at our shared border and throughout our two countries, while expediting legitimate and vital cross-border trade and travel.  We demonstrate daily that security and efficiency go hand-in-hand, and we are building a 21st century border through initiatives such as pre-clearance of people and integrated cross-border law enforcement operations.  In addition, our two countries are committed to a coordinated entry-exit information system so that records of land and air entries into one country establish exit records for the other.  

Recognizing the success of pre-clearance operations for travelers, we commit to establishing pre-clearance operations for cargo.  We intend to accelerate the completion of pre-clearance for additional cities and continue to expand this program. Not only will these efforts enhance efficiency at our shared border, they will also strengthen our shared security.  In the spirit of a more efficient and secure border, we will also examine ways to further integrate our border operations, including analysis of the feasibility of co-locating border officials in common processing facilities.  

Because we share a strong concern about the increase in opioid-related deaths, our countries will work together on common solutions to protect our people from opioid trafficking.  

Given the integrated nature of the infrastructure that supports our intertwined economies, cyber threats to either country can affect the other.  We therefore commit to further cooperation to enhance critical infrastructure security, cyber incident management, public awareness, private sector engagement, and capacity building initiatives. 

Allies in the World

We are indispensable allies in the defense of North America and other parts of the world, through NATO and other multilateral efforts.  Our troops have time and again fought together and sacrificed their lives for our shared values.  The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) illustrates the strength of our mutual commitment.  United States and Canadian forces jointly conduct aerospace warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning in defense of North America.  We will work to modernize and broaden our NORAD Partnership in these key domains, as well as in cyber and space.  

The United States welcomes Canada's recently announced decision to launch an open and transparent competition to replace its legacy fleet of CF-18 fighter aircraft.  The United States also welcomes Canada's decision to explore the immediate acquisition of 18 new Super Hornet aircraft as an interim capability to supplement the CF-18s until the permanent replacement is ready.  Canada appreciates the cooperation of the United States to facilitate these processes. 

The United States values Canada's military contributions, including in the Global Coalition to Counter-ISIS and in Latvia.  Together, we are harnessing all elements of national power to achieve the goal of degrading and destroying ISIS through our military operations to deny it safe havens and to build the capacity of local partners, stop the flow of foreign terrorist fighters into the Middle East region, cut off access to financing and funding, counter the ISIS narrative, and support the stabilization of communities liberated from ISIS. 

Empowering Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders 

It is a priority of both countries to ensure equal opportunities for women in the workforce.  We are committed to removing barriers to women's participation in the business community and supporting women as they advance through it.  As part of this effort, we are creating a United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders.  We expect this initiative to promote the growth of women-owned enterprises and to further contribute to our overall economic growth and competitiveness, as well as the enhanced integration of our economies. 

The Way Forward

We share a commitment to continue to strengthen our ties for the benefit of our mutual prosperity and security. We look forward to our cabinets following up on today's meeting with further discussions in their respective areas of responsibility.  Our countries deserve our full commitment to increased economic growth, which we will deliver.  The partnership between the United States and Canada will continue to be unique and a model for the world.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/photos/a.488852220724.393301.153080620724/10158645699465725/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158645699465725:0,13/2/17 16:59,52274,5199,2757,48687,2953,122,352,17,143153080620724_10158645020205725,Wonderful meeting with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and a group of leading CEO's & business women from Canada_Ÿ‡¨_Ÿ‡_and the United States_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸,Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/photos/a.488852220724.393301.153080620724/10158645020205725/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158645020205725:0,13/2/17 14:04,155769,7945,7142,145303,8715,280,1184,46,241153080620724_10158644488865725,Join me for a few minutes as I meet with Canadian PM Trudeau and a group of leading CEO business women from the United States and Canada - to discuss women in the workforce.,,video,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/videos/10158644488865725/,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/videos/10158644488865725/,13/2/17 12:14,124264,36668,11733,99244,21731,595,1429,217,1048153080620724_10158644423875725,Welcome to the White House Prime Minister Justin Trudeau! _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡¨_Ÿ‡_,Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/photos/a.488852220724.393301.153080620724/10158644423875725/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158644423875725:0,13/2/17 12:02,127014,5578,4350,118703,5529,342,2027,52,361153080620724_10158644313150725,We have a GREAT afternoon of meeting planned.

Recent Iranian actions, including a provocative ballistic missile launch and an attack against a Saudi naval vessel conducted by Iran-supported Houthi militants, underscore what should have been clear to the international community all along about Iran's destabilizing behavior across the Middle East.

The recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran ""not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.

These are just the latest of a series of incidents in the past six months in which Houthi forces that Iran has trained and armed have struck Emirati and Saudi vessels, and threatened U.S. and allied vessels transiting the Red Sea.  In these and other similar activities, Iran continues to threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region.

The Obama Administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran's malign actionsâ€”including weapons transfers, support for terrorism, and other violations of international norms.  The Trump Administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity, and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East and place American lives at risk.

President Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran and the Obama Administration, as well as the United Nations â€“ as being weak and ineffective.

Instead of being thankful to the United States for these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened. 

As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158584236705725,1/2/17 14:37,110143,12004,18588,97133,7973,3501,427,199,910153080620724_10158583501875725,â€ªMoment of prayer last night after my nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for #SCOTUS.

Trump Nominates Judge Neil Gorsuch to the United States Supreme Court

Today, President Donald J. Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. The nomination of Judge Gorsuch comes after a selection process marked by an unprecedented level of transparency and involvement by the American voters.

""I am proud to announce the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for Justice of the Supreme Court,"" President Trump said. ""This has been the most transparent and most important Supreme Court selection process in the history of our country and I wanted the American people to have a voice in this nomination. Judge Gorsuch has a superb intellect, an unparalleled legal education, and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to its text. He will make an incredible Justice as soon as the Senate confirms him.""

Judge Gorsuch was born and raised in Colorado. He attended Columbia University and Harvard Law School. After graduating with honors, he received his doctorate from Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar. Judge Gorsuch clerked for Judge David Sentelle of the D.C. Circuit and both Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Following a successful career in private practice, Judge Gorsuch joined the Department of Justice as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General. In 2006, President George W. Bush nominated him for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, and he was confirmed by voice vote without objection.

Highlights From The President's Listening Session With Pharmaceutical Industry Leaders-

PRESIDENT TRUMP: ""You folks have done a terrific job over the years, but we have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice. For Medicare, for Medicaid, we have to get the prices way down, so that's what we're going to be talking about. We're also going to be streamlining the process so that from your standpoint when you have drug you can actually get it approved, if it works instead of waiting for many, many years. The U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country but the pricing has been astronomical for our country.""

President Trump Focused On Cutting Regulations To Encourage Drug Companies To Bring Back Operations And Jobs To The United States

PRESIDENT TRUMP: ""So you have to get your companies back here. We have to make progress back. We're going to get rid of a tremendous number of regulations. I know you have some problems where you cannot even think about opening up new plants and then you can't get approval for the plant and then you can't get approval to make the drug.""

President Trump On Appointing A Leader To Streamline The FDA To Reduce Prices And Get New Products On The Market Faster:

PRESIDENT TRUMP: ""We're going to streamline the FDA, we have a fantastic person that I think I we'll be naming fairly soon, he's going to streamline the FDA and you're going to get your products either approved or not approved but it's going to be a quick process. It's not going to take 15 years. And we're going to do I think a tremendous -- I think we're going to make a tremendous difference to you. I read where it costs sometimes $2.5 billion on average, actually, to come up with a new product. Is that correct? 15 years, $2.5 billion to come up with a product where there's not even a safety problem. So it's crazy.

Our trade policy will prioritize that foreign countries pay their fair share for U.S.-manufactured drugs, so our drug companies have greater financial resources to accelerate development of new cures -- I think that's so important!

The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States. This order was approved as to form and legality by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel.
 
Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.
 
It is time to get serious about protecting our country. Calling for tougher vetting for individuals travelling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.
 
Tonight, President Trump relieved Ms. Yates of her duties and subsequently named Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as Acting Attorney General until Senator Jeff Sessions is finally confirmed by the Senate, where he is being wrongly held up by Democrat senators for strictly political reasons.

We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. 

This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days.

We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.

Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.
We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done. Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.

Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another â€“ but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.

For too long, a small group in our nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.
Washington flourished â€“ but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered â€“ but the jobs left, and the factories closed.
The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation's Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. 

That all changes â€“ starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you! It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country.

What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.  
The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. 

Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.

Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.
These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.

This American carnage stops RIGHT HERE and stops RIGHT NOW. We are one nation â€“ and their pain is our pain.  Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.

The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;
Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military; We've defended other nation's borders while refusing to defend our own;
And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.

We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.
One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.

The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.
But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.

We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.
From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.

From this moment on, it's going to be America First. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.

I will fight for you with every breath in my body â€“ and I will never, ever let you down.
America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders.  We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.

We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.
We will get our people off of welfare and back to work â€“ rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.

We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world â€“ but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.

We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.

We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones â€“ and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.

At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.

The Bible tells us, ""how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.""
We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear â€“ we are protected, and we will always be protected. 

We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.

Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.
We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action â€“ constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.

The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.

Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done.  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.

We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.

A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions. It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator. 

So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.

Together, We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Wealthy Again.
We Will Make America Proud Again.
We Will Make America Safe Again....

and Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless America.

The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lifted up the conscience of our nation -- a towering leader in his day, and a lasting inspiration for all generations to follow. 
 
Our Declaration declares that 'all men are created equal,' and Dr. King challenged our nation to live out that sacred truth: to banish the evils of bigotry, segregation and oppression from the  institutions of society and the hearts of men.
 
His legacy of freedom is the true memorial to his life: no testimonial can pay better tribute than the faces of young children living out their dreams.
 
But his work is not done: all around us today we see communities and schools falling behind and not sharing in the prosperity of American life. Each of us has a solemn obligation to ensure that no American is left behind -- and that all Americans are fully included in the American Dream. When young Americans of color are left on the sidelines, our nation is denied a lifetime of contributions to this society -- and when any of our American brothers and sisters is forced to live in fear, or poverty, or violence, it is setback for the entire nation. 
 
We rise and fall together, and today we pledge to follow in Dr. King's footsteps so that all Americans may know the full blessings of this God-blessed land.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158487953075725,16/1/17 9:11,333078,18301,52788,298124,32073,482,1956,77,366153080620724_10158485138565725,5 DAYS! #MAGA,Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/photos/a.488852220724.393301.153080620724/10158485138565725/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158485138565725:0,15/1/17 20:41,205050,10989,17620,181458,19855,419,1630,723,965153080620724_10158483829000725,"For many years our country has been divided, angry and untrusting.

(New York, NY) â€” President-elect Trump is very pleased to announce former Mayor Rudy Giuliani will be sharing his expertise and insight as a trusted friend concerning private sector cyber security problems and emerging solutions developing in the private sector. This is a rapidly evolving field both as to intrusions and solutions and it is critically important to get timely information from all sources.

In addition, from time to time because of the changing nature of this problem, it is contemplated that the President-elect will be hosting a series of meetings with senior corporate executives from companies which have faced or are facing challenges similar to those facing the government and public entities today, such as hacking, intrusions, disruptions, manipulations, theft of data and identities, and securing information technology infrastructure.

The President-elect's intent is to obtain experiential and anecdotal information from each executive on challenges faced by his/her company, how the company met the challenges, approaches which were productive or successful, and those which were not. The attendees may or may not change from session to session, but the specific agenda subjects will likely change because of the rapidly evolving field of cyber security, and frequent developments, both positive and negative. No consensus advice or recommendations resulting from group deliberations or interaction is expected or will be solicited.

Cyber intrusion is the fastest growing crime in the United States and much of the world. Its impact is felt from the individual citizen whose identity is stolen to the large private and government entities that have seen their confidential information seriously compromised. It is also a major threat to our national security.

As the use of modern communications and technology has moved forward at unparalleled speed the necessary defenses have lagged behind. The President-elect recognizes that this needs immediate attention and input from private sector leaders to help the government plan to make us more secure.
Mr. Giuliani was asked to initiate this process because of his long and very successful government career in law enforcement and his now sixteen years of work providing security solutions in the private sector.

Trump Intends to Nominate Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State

(New York, NY) â€“ President-elect Donald J. Trump today announced his intent to nominate Mr. Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, to serve as Secretary of the United States Department of State.
 
Among the most accomplished business leaders and international dealmakers in the world, Mr. Tillerson has spent his career protecting the jobs of his employees, who number more than 70,000. Guiding operations around the world that include more than 200 offices, Mr. Tillerson knows how to manage a global organization and successfully navigate the complex architecture of world affairs and diverse foreign leaders. As Secretary of State, he will be a forceful and clear-eyed advocate for America's vital national interests, and help reverse years of misguided foreign policies and actions that have weakened America's security and standing in the world. The American people will once again have a world-class leader working on their behalf, enhancing the prospects for peace and prosperity among nations.
 
""Rex Tillerson's career is the embodiment of the American dream. Through hard work, dedication and smart deal making, Rex rose through the ranks to become CEO of ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest and most respected companies,"" said President-elect Donald J. Trump. ""His tenacity, broad experience and deep understanding of geopolitics make him an excellent choice for Secretary of State. He will promote regional stability and focus on the core national security interests of the United States. Rex knows how to manage a global enterprise, which is crucial to running a successful State Department, and his relationships with leaders all over the world are second to none. I can think of no one more prepared, and no one more dedicated, to serve as Secretary of State at this critical time in our history.""
 
""I am honored by President-elect Trump's nomination and share his vision for restoring the credibility of the United States' foreign relations and advancing our country's national security,"" said Mr. Tillerson. ""We must focus on strengthening our alliances, pursuing shared national interests and enhancing the strength, security and sovereignty of the United States.""
 
Rex Tillerson is a native Texan who earned a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. He began his career at Exxon Company, U.S.A. in 1975 as a production engineer.
 
After years of hard work and dedication to his company, Rex then became general manager of Exxon Company, U.S.A.'s central production division, responsible for oil and gas production operations throughout a large portion of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kansas.
 
In 1992, Mr. Tillerson was named production advisor to Exxon Corporation. Three years later he was named president of Exxon Yemen Inc. and Esso Exploration and Production Khorat Inc., and in January 1998, he was promoted to vice president of Exxon Ventures (CIS) Inc. and president of Exxon Neftegas Limited. In those roles, he was responsible for Exxon's holdings in Russia and the Caspian Sea as well as the Sakhalin I consortium operations offshore Sakhalin Island, Russia.
 
In December 1999, he became executive vice president of Exxon Mobil Development Company. Mr. Tillerson was then named senior vice president of Exxon Mobil Corporation in August 2001, and was elected president of the corporation and member of the board of directors on March 1, 2004. Nearly two years after he was elected, Mr. Tillerson was named as chairman and CEO of the board on January 1, 2006.
 
Mr. Tillerson is not only a stalwart in his professional life, but also in the community. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and a trustee of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He is the vice chairman of the Ford's Theatre Society and a recipient of the Lincoln Medal; immediate past national president of the Boy Scouts of America, a Distinguished Eagle Scout, and a former director of the United Negro College Fund. He was recognized as a distinguished alumnus of the University of Texas at Austin in 2006, and in 2013, was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/photos/a.488852220724.393301.153080620724/10158289512015725/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158289512015725:0,13/12/16 8:02,44356,5180,4044,39831,3313,303,131,60,718153080620724_10158286816540725,The final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up additional votes.

An expert in Constitutional law and one of the country's top attorneys general, Pruitt brings a deep understanding of the impact of regulations on both the environment and the economy making him an excellent choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.
 
""For too long, the Environmental Protection Agency has spent taxpayer dollars on an out-of-control anti-energy agenda that has destroyed millions of jobs, while also undermining our incredible farmers and many other businesses and industries at every turn. As my EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, the highly respected Attorney General from the state of Oklahoma, will reverse this trend and restore the EPA's essential mission of keeping our air and our water clean and safe,"" said President-elect Donald Trump. ""My administration strongly believes in environmental protection, and Scott Pruitt will be a powerful advocate for that mission while promoting jobs, safety and opportunity.""

""The American people are tired of seeing billions of dollars drained from our economy due to unnecessary EPA regulations, and I intend to run this agency in a way that fosters both responsible protection of the environment and freedom for American businesses.""
 
Mr. Pruitt will be deeply involved in the implementation of President-elect Trump's energy plan, which will move America toward energy independence, create millions of new jobs and protect clean air and water.
 
Mr. Pruitt will ensure that we conserve our natural habitats, reserves and resources, while unleashing an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country. Mr. Pruitt agrees with President-elect Trump that we must rescind all job-destroying executive actions and eliminate all barriers to responsible energy production. This will create at least a half million jobs each year and produce $30 billion in higher wages.
 
Mr. Pruitt has been a national leader against the EPA's job-killing war on coal. As Oklahoma's Attorney General, Pruitt established the state's first ""federalism unit"" to combat unwarranted regulation and overreach by the federal government.

Gov. Branstad is the longest serving governor in American history, having served from 1983 to 1999 and again from 2011 until the present. Since leading his first delegation to Hebei Province in 1984, the Governor has led six trade missions to China meeting with numerous provincial governors, ministerial leaders and local officials.
 
Gov. Branstad is considered an ""old friend"", a culturally significant title, by President Xi and has a long-standing relationship with the Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai.   
 
Gov. Branstad collaborated with the Ministry of Agriculture for China, including meetings with Minister Han Changfu and has worked closely with Madam Li Xiaolin of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries to further relationships between states in America and Chinese provinces.
 
Gov. Branstad was born, raised and educated in Iowa. A native of Leland, Branstad was elected to the Iowa House in 1972, '74 and '76, and elected as Iowa's lieutenant governor in 1978. Following his four terms as governor, Branstad went on to serve as president of Des Moines University from 2003-2009. On November 2, 2010 he was again elected governor where, under his leadership, the state of Iowa's unemployment has fallen to 4.1 percent, well below the national average.  
 
Gov. Branstad supports President-elect Trump's mission to negotiate trade deals that put America's interests first. He will work with President-elect Trump's economic team to negotiate fair trade deals that create American jobs, increase American wages, and reduce America's trade deficit. He will also work with President-elect Trump's national security team to implement an America First foreign policy that will advance America's core national interests and promote regional stability.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/photos/a.488852220724.393301.153080620724/10158245436265725/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158245436265725:0,7/12/16 17:04,18724,1254,1288,17317,1153,148,52,8,46153080620724_10158245136120725,"Honoring the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt, we will conserve and protect our beautiful natural resources for the next generation â€“ including protecting lands for anglers, hunters and all who enjoy the outdoors.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158245136120725,7/12/16 16:15,107252,4374,8299,98976,7622,123,434,16,81153080620724_10158244464085725,'Trump's win pushed this manufacturer to return to the U.S.',Trump's win pushed this manufacturer to return to the U.S.,link,http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/07/technology/translux-manufacturing-trump/,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158244464085725,7/12/16 15:00,128578,3946,16528,118475,8587,1089,330,14,83153080620724_10158244280375725,"We pause today to remember the 2,403 American heroes who selflessly gave their lives at Pearl Harbor 75 years ago, on a date that will forever live in infamy.

Their shared sacrifice reminds us of the great costs paid by those who came before us to secure the liberties we enjoy, and inspires us to rise to meet the new challenges that stand before us today.

America's enemies have changed over the past 75 years. But the fact remains, as President Reagan said when first proclaiming National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 'there can be no substitute for victory' in the pursuit of peace. Today we are the bearers of the torch of freedom these brave Americans passed on to us.

In honor of their faithfulness, and for the sake of generations to come, we will never allow that flame to be extinguished.

Trump Intends to Nominate Dr. Ben Carson as Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development

(New York, NY) - President-elect Donald J. Trump today announced his intent to nominate Dr. Ben Carson to serve as Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
 
Dr. Carson is a distinguished national leader who overcame his troubled youth in the inner city of Detroit to become a renowned neurosurgeon who served as the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Maryland. 

""I am thrilled to nominate Dr. Ben Carson as our next Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ben Carson has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communities. We have talked at length about my urban renewal agenda and our message of economic revival, very much including our inner cities. Ben shares my optimism about the future of our country and is part of ensuring that this is a Presidency representing all Americans. He is a tough competitor and never gives up.""
 
""I am honored to accept the opportunity to serve our country in the Trump administration,"" said Dr. Carson. ""I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly by strengthening communities that are most in need. We have much work to do in enhancing every aspect of our nation and ensuring that our nation's housing needs are met.""
 
Ben Carson was born in Detroit, Michigan on September 18, 1951. While his mother lacked access to a quality education, she encouraged her sons in their scholastic pursuits and instilled the value of hard work. Carson graduated with honors from Southwestern High School, where he also became a senior commander in the school's ROTC program. He earned a full scholarship to Yale University and graduated in 1973 with a B.A. degree in psychology.  
 
Carson then enrolled in the School of Medicine at the University of Michigan, choosing to become a neurosurgeon. Dr. Carson became the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital at age 33 and earned fame for his groundbreaking work separating conjoined twins.
 
Twenty years ago, Carson and his wife Candy started the Carson Scholars Fund, which is now active in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. It has provided more than 7,300 scholarships since 1994 to students from all backgrounds that achieve at the highest academic levels and community service. It also encompasses the Reading Room program and reading rooms have been placed throughout the country to stimulate a love for reading, especially in those who are underserved.
 
In 2000, the Library of Congress selected Dr. Carson as one of its ""Living Legends."" The following year, CNN and Time magazine named Dr. Carson as one of the nation's 20 foremost physicians and scientists. In 2006, he received the Spingarn Medal, the highest honor bestowed by the NAACP. In February 2008, President George W. Bush awarded Dr. Carson the Ford's Theatre Lincoln Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/photos/a.488852220724.393301.153080620724/10158231301535725/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158231301535725:0,5/12/16 7:10,124104,6486,11257,109927,13087,288,589,40,173153080620724_10158229642705725,"Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?

Trump today announced his intent to nominate Steven Mnuchin as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Treasury, Wilbur Ross as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce and Todd Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce. This team will be instrumental in implementing the President-elect's America First economic plan that will create more than 25 million jobs over the next decade.
 
Mr. Mnuchin has decades of financial management experience including serving as Chief Information Officer at Goldman Sachs as well as finance director for President-elect Trump's presidential campaign.
 
""Steve Mnuchin is a world-class financier, banker and businessman, and has played a key role in developing our plan to build a dynamic, booming economy that will create millions of jobs,"" said President-elect Trump. ""His expertise and pro-growth ideas make him the ideal candidate to serve as Secretary of the Treasury. He purchased IndyMac Bank for $1.6 billion and ran it very professionally, selling it for $3.4 billion plus a return of capital. That's the kind of people I want in my administration representing our country.""

""I am honored to have the opportunity to serve our great country in this important role. I understand what needs to be done to fix the economy. I look forward to helping President-elect Trump implement a bold economic agenda that creates good-paying jobs and defends the American worker,"" said Mr. Mnuchin.
 
Since 2004, Mr. Mnuchin has been the Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Dune Capital Management, one of the country's premier investment firms, specializing in public equity markets, real estate and the entertainment industry. He also founded OneWest Bank Group LLC in 2009 and served as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 
 
Prior to that, Mr. Mnuchin worked for 17 years at Goldman Sachs, where he oversaw trading in government securities, mortgages, money markets, and municipal bonds and rose to become the company's Chief Information Officer.
 
Mr. Mnuchin has extensive experience in investing and financing the entertainment business. He founded RatPac-Dune Entertainment, which has produced wildly successful films, including Avatar, the highest grossing film in history ($2.8B worldwide), American Sniper, the X-Men series and many more.
 
He is a Member of the Board of The Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles (MOCA), UCLA Health System Board, New York Presbyterian Hospital, the Los Angeles Police Foundation, and Life Trustee of New York Presbyterian Hospital. Mr. Mnuchin has a bachelor's degree from Yale University.
 
In addition, President-elect Trump announced his intent to nominate Wilbur Ross as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce, a man renowned for his extraordinary business career and economic expertise.
 
""Wilbur Ross is a champion of American manufacturing and knows how to help companies succeed. Most importantly, he is one of the greatest negotiators I have ever met, and that comes from me, the author of The Art of the Deal. Together, we will take on the special interests and stand up for American jobs,"" said President-elect Trump. ""Wilbur knows that cutting taxes for working families, reducing burdensome government regulations and unleashing America's energy resources will strengthen our economy at a time when our country needs to see significant growth. I am proud to nominate him as Secretary of Commerce."" 

""I am delighted to have been selected to join President-elect Trump's Cabinet and look forward to working especially closely with Steve Mnuchin to implement the economic programs which we have developed jointly to implement the President-elect's strategy for accelerating our economic growth,"" said Mr. Ross.
 
For 25 years Mr. Ross headed Rothschild Inc. where he built a legacy of saving jobs and restructuring failing companies back to profitability. He has successfully grown businesses in the telecommunications, textiles, steel, and coal industries. In 2000, Mr. Ross started the investment firm WL Ross & Co.
 
Mr. Ross served as the President-elect's top economic advisor on trade policy. He agrees with President-elect Trump's plan to bring back jobs, eliminate the trade deficit and make good deals for America's workers. He is a world-class negotiator and can be counted on to be a forceful advocate for America's interests in the global economy. He received a bachelor's degree from Yale University and his MBA from Harvard University.
 
In addition to Mr. Ross' nomination, President-elect Trump announced his choice of Todd Ricketts, co-owner of the Chicago Cubs, to serve as Deputy Commerce Secretary.
 
""Todd Ricketts is an immensely successful businessman with unparalleled knowledge of the finance industry,"" said President-elect Trump. ""As Deputy Commerce Secretary he will help us cut waste and streamline government so that it works for the people of America. The incredible job he and the Ricketts family did in the purchase and turnaround of the Chicago Cubs â€“ one perfect step after another, leading to the World Championship, is what I want representing our people. I am very proud to have him on our team.""
 
""I am honored that President-elect Donald J. Trump has asked me to serve our country at this critical juncture in our history. Advancing practical policies that promote economic opportunity is critical to making America great again. I'm eager to begin this important work and serving with Wilbur Ross to implement President-elect Trump's economic agenda, which will improve the lives of all Americans,"" said Mr. Ricketts.
 
Mr. Ricketts is committed to promoting the values of fiscal responsibility and educating taxpayers on wasteful and excessive government spending. He is the son of Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts and has years of hands-on experience in the finance industry.  Like President-elect Trump, Mr. Ricketts will use this knowledge to fix the broken Washington D.C. system, keep jobs in the United States and spur job growth.
 
Mr. Ricketts has consistently spearheaded efforts to defend the taxpayers' money.  Ricketts is a graduate of Loyola University Chicago. In 2016, Mr. Ricketts helped deliver a World Series Championship to the people of Chicago as a key member of the Cubs ownership group.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/photos/a.488852220724.393301.153080620724/10158207891610725/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158207891610725:0,30/11/16 11:13,31949,3624,2840,29327,2180,116,175,16,135153080620724_10158207729460725,"Join me in Cincinnati, Ohio tomorrow evening at 7:00pm!

Trump today announced his intent to nominate Elaine Chao to serve as Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation. Having served as Deputy Secretary at the U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary of the Department of Labor, Chao brings unparalleled experience and insight to the role.
 
""Secretary Chao's extensive record of strong leadership and her expertise are invaluable assets in our mission to rebuild our infrastructure in a fiscally responsible manner,"" said President-elect Trump. ""She has an amazing life story and has helped countless Americans in her public service career. I am pleased to nominate Elaine as Secretary of the Department of Transportation.""
 
""The President-elect has outlined a clear vision to transform our country's infrastructure, accelerate economic growth and productivity, and create good paying jobs across the country,"" said Ms. Chao. ""I am honored to be nominated by the President-elect to serve my beloved country as Transportation Secretary.""

Elaine L. Chao is a Distinguished Fellow at Hudson Institute.  She is the 24th U.S. Secretary of Labor who served from 2001-2009.  She is the first American woman of Asian descent to be appointed to a President's Cabinet in our nation's history. 
 
An immigrant who arrived in America at the age of eight speaking not a word of English, Chao received her U.S. Citizenship when she was 19 years old.  Secretary Chao's experience transitioning to a new country has motivated her to devote most of her professional life to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to build better lives. 
 
Secretary Chao has a distinguished career in the public, private and nonprofit sectors.  As the first Secretary of Labor in the 21st Century, she focused on increasing the competitiveness of America's workforce in a global economy and achieved record results in workplace safety and health. 
 
Prior to the Department of Labor, Secretary Chao was President and Chief Executive Officer of United Way of America where she restored public trust and confidence in one of our nation's premier institutions of private charitable giving after it had been tarnished by financial mismanagement and abuse.  As director of the Peace Corps, she established the first programs in the Baltic nations and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union.  Her government service also includes serving as Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission. She has also worked in the private sector as Vice President of Syndications at Bank of America Capital Markets Group and Citicorp.  
 
Secretary Chao earned her MBA from the Harvard Business School and an economics degree from Mount Holyoke College.  Recognized for her extensive record of accomplishments and public service, she is the recipient of 35 honorary doctorate degrees. 

Michael Sacco, president of the Seafarers International Union, said, ""There is nobody better qualified to be Secretary of Transportation than Elaine Chao. Throughout her time in government, Elaine Chao has long been a steadfast friend to the SIU and to maritime labor. The industry has no better supporter than Elaine Chao, and she has stood up to defend the Jones Act, the Maritime Security Program, cargo preference and the other key programs that keep our industry alive. She understands the importance of providing jobs to America's working families, and she has seen firsthand the value of the United States Merchant Marine to our nation's defense and prosperity. We look forward to working with her again.""
 
""Elaine Chao is an outstanding choice as Secretary of Transportation.  She has been an effective leader in government, the private sector, and in the non-profit sector.  I believe she will be able to pull these different stakeholders together for the good of the country,"" said Brian Gallagher, president and CEO of United Way Worldwide.
 
""The first Asian Pacific American woman to be appointed to the President's Cabinet, Secretary Chao was also a great Deputy Secretary of Transportation and has extensive experience in transportation.  She will help improve our country's infrastructure and create more jobs.  This is wonderful news for the Asian Pacific American community,"" said Chiling Tong, CEO of the International Leadership Foundation.
 
Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the New York City Police Department (SBA), a labor union representing more than 13,000 active and retired police sergeants, praised President-elect Trump's selection of Elaine Chao.
 
""The men and women I represent will always be grateful for the skill and tenacity Elaine Chao displayed in pushing through expanded overtime protections for millions of Americansâ€”including police officersâ€”and defending them from employers, like the City of New York, that tried to take them away from working men and women,"" said Mullins.  ""The American people can rest assured that as Secretary of Transportation she will demonstrate the same skill, energy, and commitment to the concerns of ordinary Americans that were the hallmarks of her tenure at the Labor Department. The SBA calls on Congress to quickly confirm Elaine L. Chao as Secretary of Transportation.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/photos/a.488852220724.393301.153080620724/10158205142380725/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158205142380725:0,29/11/16 18:49,46578,5226,4541,42731,2861,440,166,56,324153080620724_10158204328375725,My thoughts and prayers are with the great people of Tennessee during these terrible wildfires.

Fidel Castro's legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.
 
While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.

Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. I join the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba.
