> Produce 101 Season 2 (Hangul: 프로듀스 101 시즌 2) is a 2017 reality boy band survival show on Mnet. It is a large-scale project in which the public "produces" a unit boy band by choosing members from a pool of 101 trainees from 54 entertainment companies as well as the group's concept, debut song, and group name. 11 trainees will be selected to form a unit boy group.
