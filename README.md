# Data Science Projects

This repository documents all my data science projects, where I explore different machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics. Built by [Debby Ling](https://www.linkedin.com/in/debby-ling-74944226/)

## 1. Produce 101 Season 2 Predictions
- Used RandomForestRegressor to predict the top 11 contestants of Produce 101 Season 2 to achieve accuracy of 82.9%, from 5 weeks of data.

> *"Produce 101 Season 2 (프로듀스 101 시즌 2) is a 2017 reality boy band survival show on Mnet. It is a large-scale project in which the public "produces" a unit boy band by choosing members from a pool of 101 trainees from 54 entertainment companies as well as the group's concept, debut song, and group name. 11 trainees will be selected to form the unit boy group."* Wikipedia

## 2. Blood Donation
- With Support Vector Machine, predicted with 99% accuracy whether a donor would donate blood in the subsequent month.

## 3. Students' results
- Nature or nurture -- will the education level of parents influence that of their child? Is the education level of a father a greater determinant? [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/23/fathers-education-child-success-school) and [conventional wisdom](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2853053/) affirms this. Using simple linear regression, I predict with 97% accuracy the results of students.

## 4. Wells
- With Artificial Neural Networks, predicted the state of wells in Tanzania using artificial neural networks and xgboost with a 70% accuracy.

## 5. Nutella - Public Relations Disaster?
- Nutella's change in recipe was a public relations disaster. Or was it? Although the news was first revealed on Facebook on 2 Nov, most of social media didn't quite react until a [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5055611/Nutella-fans-nuts-company-changes-recipe.html) article was published on the 6th. While Nutella did take a hit in the positivity of sentiments on Twitter that day, sentiments on Twitter recovered quickly.
